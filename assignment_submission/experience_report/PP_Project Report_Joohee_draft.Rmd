# PP Participation Project: Experience Report #

I participated in the work of a peer-production community called **Namuwiki**, the most famous wiki in South Korea. I expect to understand the process of contribution for this community by editing its topics and understand how the participation works and how it is verified based on **Namuwiki**'s policy. I will compare its policy with Wikipedia in English in terms of the neutral point of view policy. 

## My participation in **Namuwiki**##
First, I made my account and logged in as it is necessary to edit specific topics. I then tried to choose a topic from the recent popular ones, but I was not familiar with those. Therefore, I searched the topic of "Austin" and found there was not much information about it. I clicked the editing button and started to make my contribution. The previous version seemed to be written by a user who has lived in Austin, explaining this city in informal ways. It was written in the way of describing a story, containing positive (not neutral) feelings about Austin from a person's experience, which made it easy and fun to read. To illustrate, after explaining the unofficial slogan of "Keep Austin Weird," a user also added, "people in Austin seem open-minded with a new culture and people from other places. People are kind and helpful to out of towners, which means Austin weird in a good way." It might depend on individuals, but I think it could be an excellent reference to some people who are planning to travel to or live in Austin. However, if every explanation would be written in this biased way, it would confuse people who don't know about Austin at all, triggering misunderstandings and prejudices. 
I divided the contents into separate paragraphs, rearranging their orders to make it have subcategories, including history, demographics and political tendencies, culture and sports, etc. After that, I added more information about Austin's food industry, mentioning the fact that Austin has the headquarters of Whole Foods and some famous Barbeque restaurants, but not listing specific names. Then I saved the page and saw it was uploaded on the list of the newly edited document. This participation was recorded as my contribution to **Namuwiki**

## What I learned from my experience ##
While waiting for any review or reaction to what I contributed, I also searched Austin from Wikipedia. In its page, Austin's history, geopolitical characteristics, climate, environment, traffic, and politics are described in separate paragraphs. Also, "Keep Austin Weird," refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. This information might be a good source for research because it describes this topic without subjective views. This is due to the fact that Wikipedia was created based on the model of the encyclopedia, and has a NPOV(neutral point of view) policy dealing with how to maintain neturality. (Butler, B., Joyce, E., & Pike, J., 2008). **Namuwiki**, however, started from a community that used to share information and evaluations for a specific subcultural artifact. This origin has led to creating **Namuwiki**'s unique features, such as sharing more detailed information about particular topics, allowing different points of view and debating over them.  

A couple of days later, another contribution was added on Austin's page on **Namuwiki**. Another user said Tex-mex should be added to popular food in Austin other than Texas Barbeque. The user also mentioned it is true that Austin is weird in a positive way, but not every Austinite is kind to out-of-towners. They still have some aspects of conservativeness based on their location and history. These opinions might be debated on forums and concluded to show both opinions which I believe is the strength of **Namuwiki** to introduce different insights, allowing readers to broaden their perspectives. 

**Namuwiki** is more like an Internet bulletin board or Reddit rather than an encyclopedia. Wikipedia is used as a pronoun of the wiki, and many people mistake it, but the wiki does not mean an encyclopedia. It just refers to a knowledge base website on which users collaboratively edit content and build directly from the web browser. Therefore, **Namuwiki** is meaningful as a unique place where users get the information they want quickly and enjoy reading it. They can get even trivial information. Although it is not possible to check the source of information like Wikipedia, it is intended to provide reasonable witty information by refraining from excessive subjective opinions.
